# CM2104---MusicMap
Music Map Prototype code

Authors of Code: 

Nathan Stockdale

Stuart Komar


Please bare in mind, this site was only built by the two people mentioned. The full prototype
could have been created if there was the full team to assist work on the project.

The Spotify API is implemented and gives basic functionality to the website by listing songs associated 
with an artist.
